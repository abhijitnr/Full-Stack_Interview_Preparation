# 1. What is HTML ?

<p>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is a markup language used for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. It is the standard language used to structure content on the World Wide Web and is essential for creating web pages that are accessible and readable by users.

<p>
HTML uses tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets, to define the structure and content of a web page. These tags indicate how the content should be displayed in a browser, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, and forms. HTML also allows web developers to include other media, such as videos, audio, and animations, within web pages.
