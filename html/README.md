# 1. What is HTML ?

<p>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is a markup language used for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. It is the standard language used to structure content on the World Wide Web and is essential for creating web pages that are accessible and readable by users.
</p>
<p>
HTML uses tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets, to define the structure and content of a web page. These tags indicate how the content should be displayed in a browser, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, and forms. HTML also allows web developers to include other media, such as videos, audio, and animations, within web pages.
</p>

# 2. What are HTML tags?

<p>
HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML, and they define the structure and content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets and consist of a tag name, which indicates the type of element being defined, and optional attributes, which provide additional information about the element.
</p>

For example, the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph of text, and the `<img>` tag is used to insert an image into a web page.

Here is an example of a paragraph tag:

```
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

In this example, the `<p>` tag defines the beginning of a paragraph, and the `</p>` tag defines the end of the paragraph.

<p>
HTML tags can be nested inside each other to create more complex structures, such as tables, lists, and forms. The way these tags are structured and nested determines the layout and appearance of a web page.
</p>

# 3. What are HTML Attributes?

<p>
HTML attributes are additional properties that can be added to HTML elements to provide extra information about the element. They are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an HTML element, or to provide additional information about the element to search engines, browsers, or other software that may process the web page.
</p>

<p>
HTML attributes are specified in the opening tag of an HTML element, using the attribute name followed by an equals sign and the attribute value enclosed in quotes. For example, the "href" attribute is used to specify the URL of a link, and the "alt" attribute is used to provide alternative text for an image.
</p>

Here is an example of an HTML anchor tag with an "href" attribute:

```
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

# 4. What are HTML Elements?

<p>
HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. An HTML element is represented by a tag in the HTML code and is used to define the structure and content of a web page. There are different types of HTML elements, each with its own purpose.
</p>

<p>
Some common HTML elements include: Headings, Paragraphs, Links, Images, Lists, Forms etc.
</p>

# 5. What is a marquee in HTML?

The `<marquee>` tag in HTML is used to create a scrolling text or image display in a web page. The marquee tag was introduced in HTML 3.2 and has been deprecated in HTML5, which means it is no longer recommended for use, as it is not part of the modern web standards.

The `<marquee>` tag has several attributes that can be used to customize its behavior, such as direction, behavior, scroll amount, and scroll delay. The direction attribute specifies the direction of the scrolling, which can be either "left", "right", "up", or "down". The behavior attribute specifies the behavior of the scrolling, which can be "scroll", "slide", or "alternate".

Here is an example of how to use the `<marquee>` tag:

```
<marquee direction="left" behavior="scroll" scrollamount="5">This text will scroll from left to right</marquee>
```

However, it is recommended to avoid using the `<marquee>` tag in modern web development, as it can negatively affect the accessibility and usability of a website. Instead, other technologies such as CSS animations or JavaScript can be used to achieve similar effects in a more modern and accessible way.

# 6. Define the list types in HTML?

In HTML , there are three types of lists: ordered, unordered and definition list.

- <b>Unordered Lists :</b> An unordered list is a list of items that are marked with bullet points (or some other marker) to indicate each item. The unordered list is created using the `<ul>` tag, and each item in the list is created using the `<li>` tag. Here is an example:

  ```
  <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul>
  ```

- <b>Ordered Lists :</b> An ordered list is a list of items that are numbered to indicate each item's order. The ordered list is created using the `<ol>` tag, and each item in the list is created using the `<li>` tag. Here is an example:

  ```
   <ol>
      <li>First item</li>
      <li>Second item</li>
      <li>Third item</li>
   </ol>
  ```

In both types of lists, you can nest other lists and other HTML elements inside each list item by using the appropriate tags. It's also possible to change the appearance of the list markers or numbers by using CSS.

- <b>Definition list :</b> a definition list is a list of terms and their corresponding definitions. It is created using the `<dl>` tag, and each term and definition pair is created using the `<dt>` and `<dd>` tags, respectively.Here is an example of a definition list:

  ```
  <dl>
     <dt>HTML</dt>
     <dd>Hypertext Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.</dd>

     <dt>CSS</dt>
     <dd>Cascading Style Sheets - the language used to describe the presentation of web pages.</dd>

     <dt>JavaScript</dt>
     <dd>A programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages.</dd>
  </dl>
  ```

In the example above, each term (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is defined using the `<dt>` tag, and its corresponding definition is provided using the `<dd>` tag.

<p>
Definition lists are commonly used to present glossary or dictionary-like information on a web page. They can also be styled using CSS to enhance their appearance and readability.
</p>

# 7. What is formatting in HTML?

<p>
In HTML, formatting refers to the visual presentation of text and other content on a web page. Formatting can be applied to HTML elements to change their appearance, size, color, font, and other properties.
</p>

<p>
HTML provides several formatting elements and attributes to help developers control the appearance of their web pages. Here are some of the most commonly used formatting elements:
</p>

- Headings - HTML provides six levels of headings (h1 to h6) that can be used to create titles and headings of different sizes.
- Paragraphs - The `<p>` tag is used to create paragraphs of text.
- Bold and italic - The `<b>` tag is used to make text bold, while the `<i>` tag is used to make text italic.
- Underline - The `<u>` tag is used to underline text.
- Strikethrough - The `<s>` or `<strike>` tag is used to create text with a line through it.
- Font size and color - The `<font>` tag can be used to specify the font size and color of text.

It's important to note that some formatting elements, such as the `<font>` tag, are now deprecated in HTML5 and should be avoided. Instead, modern web development practices rely on Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to apply formatting and styles to HTML elements.

# 8. How do you display a table in an HTML webpage?

To display a table on an HTML webpage, you need to use the `<table>` tag, along with several other tags to define the structure and content of the table. Here are the basic steps to create a table:

- Use the `<table>` tag to create a table.
- Use the `<tr>` tag to create a table row.
- Use the `<th>` tag to create a table header cell. This is typically used for the first row of the table to create column headings.
- Use the `<td>` tag to create a table data cell. This is used to hold the actual data in the table.
- Close the table cell and row tags using the `</th>`, `</td>`, and `</tr>` tags as appropriate.
- Repeat steps 2-5 to create additional rows and cells as needed.
- Close the table using the `</table>` tag.

Here's an example of a simple table with two rows and two columns:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Column 1</th>
    <th>Column 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

<p>
In the example above, the first row contains the column headings, and the second and third rows contain the data. You can add additional rows and columns to create more complex tables as needed.
</p>

<p>
It's also possible to add formatting and styles to tables using CSS, which can enhance their appearance and improve their readability.
</p>

# 9. How to create a hyperlink in HTML?

To create a hyperlink in HTML, you need to use the `<a>` tag, which stands for "anchor". Here's the basic syntax for creating a hyperlink:

```
<a href="URL">Link text</a>
```

<p>
In this syntax, the href attribute specifies the destination URL that the link should point to, and the "Link text" is the visible text that the user clicks on to follow the link.
</p>

Here's an example of how to create a hyperlink that points to the Google homepage :

```
<a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>
```

<p>
When the user clicks on the "Go to Google" link, their web browser will navigate to the Google homepage.
</p>

You can also add additional attributes to the `<a>` tag, such as `target="_blank"` to open the link in a new window or tab, or `class` and `id` attributes for styling and scripting purposes.

# 10. How do we insert a comment in HTML?

In HTML, you can insert comments using the following syntax:

```
<!-- This is a comment -->
```

Anything within the `<!-- -->` tags will be treated as a comment and will not be displayed in the browser when the webpage is rendered. Comments are useful for adding notes or explanations to your code that are not meant to be seen by the user.

Here's an example of how to use comments in HTML to annotate your code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>My Website</title>
	<!-- This is the meta description for the website -->
	<meta name="description" content="Welcome to my website!">
</head>
<body>
	<!-- This is the header section -->
	<header>
		<h1>My Website</h1>
		<!-- This is the navigation menu -->
		<nav>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">About</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
			</ul>
		</nav>
	</header>
	<!-- This is the main content area -->
	<main>
		<p>Welcome to my website! Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed consequat ligula sed mauris malesuada, in commodo nulla consectetur.</p>
	</main>
	<!-- This is the footer section -->
	<footer>
		<p>&copy; 2023 My Website</p>
	</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

# 11. How do you insert a copyright symbol in HTML?

To insert a copyright symbol in HTML, you can use the special character entity `&copy;` or the Unicode value `&#169;`.
This will render as the copyright symbol: ©

Both methods will work in most modern web browsers, but using the `&copy;` entity is generally preferred because it is more readable and easier to understand in your HTML code.

# 12. What is semantic HTML?

<p>
Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning and purpose of the content on a webpage, rather than just its presentation. In other words, semantic HTML uses HTML tags and attributes that convey the structure and meaning of the content, rather than just how it should look on the page.
</p>
Here are a few examples of semantic HTML tags:

- `<header>` : This tag is used to define the header section of a webpage, which typically includes a logo, navigation menu, and other introductory content.
- `<nav>` : This tag is used to define the navigation menu of a webpage, which typically includes links to other pages or sections within the website.
- `<main>` : This tag is used to define the main content area of a webpage, which typically includes the primary content that the user is meant to read or interact with.
- `<article>` : This tag is used to define a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post, article, or news item.
- `<section>` : This tag is used to define a section of related content within a webpage, such as a chapter in a book, a category of products in an online store, or a group of related blog posts.

# 13. What is an image map?

<P>
An image map is an HTML element that allows you to define clickable areas within an image. Each clickable area, or "hotspot," can be linked to a different URL or action, allowing you to create interactive images that the user can click on to navigate to different pages or trigger events.
</P>

Image maps are typically created using the `<map>` and `<area>` tags. Here's an example of how to create an image map:

```
<img src="myimage.jpg" alt="My Image" usemap="#mymap">

<map name="mymap">
	<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,100,100" href="page1.html">
	<area shape="circle" coords="200,200,50" href="page2.html">
	<area shape="poly" coords="300,0,400,100,300,200" href="page3.html">
</map>
```

In this example, the `<img>` tag includes the usemap attribute, which specifies the name of the map that defines the clickable areas. The `<map>` tag defines the map and includes one or more `<area>` tags, each of which defines a clickable area with a specific shape, size, and location (coords) and a URL or action ("href").

<p>
In this example, there are three clickable areas: a rectangle that links to "page1.html", a circle that links to "page2.html", and a polygon that links to "page3.html". When the user clicks on any of these areas, they will be taken to the corresponding URL or action.
</p>

# 14. Why do we use a style sheet in HTML?

<p>
We use a style sheet in HTML to separate the presentation of a webpage from its content. By using a style sheet, we can define the visual appearance and layout of a webpage in a separate file or section of code, rather than cluttering our HTML with styling information.
</p>

<p>
There are several types of style sheets that can be used in HTML, including inline styles, internal styles, and external styles. External stylesheets are the most commonly used type of stylesheet, as they can be cached by the browser, which further improves performance.
</p>

# 15. How to create a nested webpage in HTML?

Creating a nested webpage in HTML involves embedding one HTML document within another. This can be done using `<iframe>` tag, which are used to display content from another source within a webpage.
For example:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h2>HTML Iframes example</h2>
    <p>Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe:</p>

    <iframe src="https://www.google.com/" height="300" width="400"></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```

# 16. Explain the layout of HTML?

The layout of HTML refers to the structure and organization of HTML elements that are used to create a web page. Here is a brief overview of the main components of the HTML layout:

- HTML document type declaration: The HTML layout begins with a document type declaration, which tells the web browser which version of HTML is being used.
- HTML tags: HTML tags are used to define the structure of the web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and are used to create elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.
- HTML attributes: HTML attributes are used to provide additional information about an element, such as its style or behavior. Attributes are specified within the opening tag of an element.
- Head section: The head section of an HTML document contains information about the web page that is not displayed on the page itself. This includes the title of the page, meta tags, scripts, and links to external stylesheets.
- Body section: The body section of an HTML document contains the visible content of the web page, including text, images, and other elements.
- Nested elements: HTML elements can be nested within each other, creating a hierarchical structure. This allows for the creation of more complex web page layouts, such as tables and forms.
- Comments: HTML comments can be added to the code to provide notes or reminders for the developer. Comments are enclosed within <!-- --> and are not displayed on the web page.

Overall, the layout of HTML is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing developers to create web pages that meet their specific needs and requirements.

# 17. How many tags can be used to separate a section of texts?

There are several tags in HTML that can be used to separate a section of text. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

- `<p>` tag: The `<p>` tag is used to separate a section of text into a paragraph. This is the most commonly used tag for separating text.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags: These tags are used to create headings of different sizes. They can be used to separate sections of text based on their importance or hierarchy.
- `<div>` tag: The `<div>` tag is used to create a container for a section of content. This tag is often used to group related content together, such as a group of paragraphs or images.
- `<section>` tag: The `<section>` tag is used to define a section of content within a web page. This tag is often used to group related content together, such as a group of articles or blog posts.
- `<blockquote>` tag: The `<blockquote>` tag is used to indicate that a section of text is a quotation or excerpt from another source.

These are just a few of the tags that can be used to separate a section of text in HTML. The choice of which tag to use depends on the specific needs and requirements of the web page.

# 18. What is SVG in HTML?

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and it is a markup language used to create vector-based graphics in HTML. Unlike raster images (such as JPEGs or PNGs), SVG images are resolution-independent, which means they can be scaled up or down without losing quality.

SVG graphics are created using XML code and are displayed in the web page using an `<svg>` element. The `<svg>` element can be used to create a wide range of graphics, including logos, icons, charts, and maps.

<p>
SVG graphics can also be animated using CSS or JavaScript, making them a powerful tool for creating interactive and engaging web content. Additionally, because SVG graphics are created using text-based code, they can be easily edited and customized using a text editor or graphics software.
</p>
<p>
Overall, SVG is a versatile and flexible format that allows developers to create high-quality, scalable graphics that can be used in a variety of web applications.
</p>

```
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="80" height="80" fill="blue"/>
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="30" fill="white"/>
</svg>
```

# 19. What are empty elements?

<p>
Empty elements in HTML are elements that do not have a closing tag because they do not contain any content or nested elements. They are also known as void elements or self-closing elements.
</p>

Some examples of empty elements in HTML include:

- `<img>`: Used to embed an image in a web page.
- `<br>`: Used to create a line break.
- `<input>`: Used to create form fields, such as text boxes and radio buttons.
- `<meta>`: Used to provide metadata about the web page, such as keywords and descriptions.

Empty elements are written using a self-closing tag, which consists of the element name followed by a forward slash and closing angle bracket. For example, the `<img>` element would be written as

```
<img src="image.png" alt="An image" />
```

It's important to note that not all elements that do not have a closing tag are empty elements. For example, the `<p>` element does not have a closing tag when followed by another `<p>` element, but it is not an empty element because it contains content between the opening and closing tags.

# 20. How to make a picture of a background image of a web page?

To set a picture as the background image of a web page in HTML, you can use the "background-image" property in CSS. Here's an example:

- First, add a "style" tag in the head section of your HTML document to add the CSS styling:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        background-image: url("background.jpg");
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- your HTML content here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

- In the CSS, set the "background-image" property to the URL of the image file you want to use as the background. In this example, the image file is named "background.jpg".
- Save the HTML file and the image file in the same folder on your computer.
- Open the HTML file in a web browser, and the image should appear as the background of the web page.

<p>
Note that the "background-image" property can be combined with other CSS properties to further customize the background, such as "background-repeat" to control how the image repeats, and "background-size" to control the size of the image.
</p>
<p>
Also, keep in mind that using large images as background images can slow down the loading time of your web page, so it's important to optimize your images for web use and consider using compression techniques.
</p>

# 21. What are the entities in HTML?

In HTML, an "entity" is a special character or symbol that has a specific meaning in HTML code. Entities are used to represent characters that may not be easily or safely entered as normal text. Some common entities include:

- `&` = represents the ampersand character `"&"`
- `<` = represents the less-than symbol `"<"`
- `>` = represents the greater-than symbol `">"`
- `"` = represents the double quote character `"`
- `'` = represents the single quote character `'`

There are many other entities available in HTML, including characters with diacritical marks, mathematical symbols, and special characters for different languages. To use an entity in HTML, you can simply type the entity name (including the `"&"` and `";"`) in place of the character you want to represent.

# 22. Why is a URL encoded in HTML?

<P>
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is encoded in HTML to ensure that the URL can be correctly interpreted by web browsers and other software applications.
</P>

<P>
URL encoding involves replacing certain characters in the URL with a sequence of characters that can be transmitted safely over the internet. For example, spaces in a URL must be replaced with the "%20" sequence. This encoding ensures that the URL is correctly interpreted by web browsers and other software applications, even if the URL contains special characters or other characters that might be interpreted incorrectly.
</P>

<P>
In HTML, URLs are typically used to link to other pages or resources on the web. By encoding the URL, the HTML document can include links to resources without the risk of errors or other issues that might prevent the link from working properly.
</P>

<P>
Overall, URL encoding is an important part of web development and is used to ensure that web pages and other online resources are displayed and interpreted correctly across different platforms and software applications.
</P>

# 23. Does a `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag is a HTML tag?

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is not technically an HTML tag, but it is a crucial element in an HTML document. It is actually an instruction to the web browser that tells it which version of HTML the document is written in. This is important because different versions of HTML have different rules and syntax, and the web browser needs to know which version of HTML is being used in order to properly render the page.

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is often placed at the beginning of an HTML document before the `<html>` tag, and it is considered a part of the document's metadata. It is not a visible part of the page, but it is still an essential element in HTML coding.

# 24. What is `<datalist>` tag?

The `<datalist>` tag is an HTML element that is used to provide a pre-defined list of options for an input field. It is often used in conjunction with the `<input>` tag to create an input field with a drop-down list of selectable options.

The options in the `<datalist>` tag are defined using the `<option>` tag, just like a regular select menu. The user can then select an option from the list or type their own value into the input field. The datalist is not a form control itself, but rather a list of options that can be used to assist with input.

Here is an example of how to use the `<datalist>` tag:

```
<label for="fruit">Choose a fruit:</label>
<input list="fruits" id="fruit" name="fruit">
<datalist id="fruits">
  <option value="Apple">
  <option value="Banana">
  <option value="Cherry">
  <option value="Date">
  <option value="Grape">
</datalist>
```

In this example, the `<datalist>` tag has an ID of "fruits", and the associated input field has a "list" attribute with a value of "fruits". When the user types in the input field, a drop-down list of fruit options will appear based on the options defined in the datalist. The user can then select one of the options, or type in their own value.

# 25. What is the use of `<details>` and `<summary>` tag?

The `<details>` and `<summary>` tags are HTML elements that are used together to create an interactive disclosure widget, also known as an accordion. This allows the user to expand or collapse content based on their interests.

The `<details>` tag is used to wrap a section of content that can be expanded or collapsed, and the `<summary>` tag is used to provide a title or summary for the content.

Here is an example of how to use the `<details>` and `<summary>` tags:

```
<details>
  <summary>Click to show more</summary>
  <p>Here is some additional content that can be expanded or collapsed.</p>
</details>
```

In this example, the user will initially see the summary, "Click to show more." When the user clicks on the summary, the content inside the `<details>` tag will be revealed, including the paragraph of additional content.

The `<details>` and `<summary>` tags are especially useful for providing more information or context about a particular topic, without cluttering the page with too much content. They are also helpful for organizing content in a way that is easy for users to navigate and interact with.

# 26. What is `<button>` tag?

The `<button>` tag is an HTML element that is used to create clickable buttons on a web page. When a user clicks on a button, a specified action or behavior is triggered, such as submitting a form, navigating to another page, or performing some other JavaScript function.

Here is an example of how to use the `<button>` tag:

```
<button>Click Me!</button>
```

Here is an example of how to use the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags:

# 27. What is the use of `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tag in HTML5?

The `<figure>` tag is an HTML5 element that is used to represent self-contained content, such as images, diagrams, illustrations, videos, or code snippets, that is referenced in the main content of a web page. The `<figure>` element is often used in conjunction with the `<figcaption>` element, which provides a caption or title for the content.

The `<figcaption>` tag is an HTML5 element that is used to provide a caption or title for a `<figure>` element. The `<figure>` element is used to represent self-contained content, such as images, diagrams, illustrations, videos, or code snippets.

Here is an example of how to use the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags:

```
<figure>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful image">
  <figcaption>A beautiful sunset at the beach</figcaption>
</figure>
```

In this example, the `<figure>` element contains an image, and the `<figcaption>` element provides a caption or title for the image. The src attribute of the `<img>` element specifies the URL of the image file, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is important for accessibility and SEO.

The `<figcaption>` element can contain any text, such as a description, attribution, citation, or explanation, and it can also contain other HTML elements, such as links, lists, or tables.

Overall, the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements are useful HTML5 elements for creating well-structured, accessible, and semantic web pages that are easy to read and navigate.

# 28. What is the difference between `<progress>` and `<meter>` tag?

The `<progress>` and `<meter>` tags are HTML5 elements that are used to represent the progress or status of some value or task on a web page. While they are similar in some ways, there are some key differences between the two.

The `<progress>` tag is used to display a progress bar that shows the progress of a task, such as downloading a file or completing a form. It is typically used in conjunction with JavaScript to update the progress value dynamically. The value attribute is used to specify the current progress of the task, while the max attribute is used to specify the maximum value of the progress bar.

Here is an example of how to use the `<progress>` tag:

```
<progress value="50" max="100"></progress>
```

In this example, the progress bar is 50% complete, as specified by the value attribute.

On the other hand, the `<meter>` tag is used to display a value within a specific range, such as the temperature, the battery level, or the sound volume. It is typically used to provide feedback to the user about the status of some value. The value attribute is used to specify the current value of the meter, while the min and max attributes are used to specify the minimum and maximum values of the meter.

Here is an example of how to use the `<meter>` tag:

```
<meter value="75" min="0" max="100"></meter>
```

In this example, the meter displays a value of 75, which is within the range of 0 to 100, as specified by the min and max attributes.

Overall, while both tags are used to represent progress or status, the `<progress>` tag is used for tasks that have a specific end goal, while the `<meter>` tag is used to represent values within a specific range.

# 29. What is the `<canvas>` element in HTML5?

The `<canvas>` element is an HTML5 element that provides a drawing surface for JavaScript code on a web page. It is a rectangular area on the page where you can draw graphics, animate images, or create interactive applications.

The `<canvas>` element provides a bitmap canvas that can be manipulated using JavaScript. You can draw various shapes, lines, paths, text, and images on the canvas using a set of drawing methods provided by the HTML5 Canvas API.

Here is an example of how to use the `<canvas>` tag:

```
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
```

In this example, the `<canvas>` element is created with a specific width and height. You can also set the dimensions using CSS or JavaScript.

To draw on the canvas, you need to use JavaScript code that interacts with the Canvas API. For example, you can draw a line on the canvas using the following code:

```
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
context.beginPath();
context.moveTo(0, 0);
context.lineTo(200, 100);
context.stroke();
```

In this code, the getContext() method is used to get the 2D context of the canvas, which provides a set of drawing methods. The beginPath() method starts a new path, and the moveTo() and lineTo() methods define the start and end points of a line. Finally, the stroke() method draws the line on the canvas.

Overall, the `<canvas>` element is a powerful HTML5 feature that enables developers to create dynamic and interactive graphics on web pages using JavaScript.

# 30. Which type of video formats are supported by HTML5?

HTML5 provides native support for a few different video formats, including:

- MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14)
- WebM (VP8 and VP9)
- Ogg/Theora

MP4 is the most widely used video format and is supported by all major browsers. WebM is an open-source format that was developed by Google and is gaining popularity, especially on the web. Ogg/Theora is an open-source format that is supported by some browsers, but its usage is not as widespread as MP4 or WebM.

When using the `<video>` tag to embed video in a web page, it is recommended to provide multiple sources in different formats to ensure compatibility across different browsers. This can be achieved by including multiple `<source>` tags within the `<video>` tag, each with a different video format:

```
<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="video.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="video.ogv" type="video/ogg">
</video>
```

In this example, the `<video>` tag includes three `<source>` tags, each with a different video format. The browser will automatically select the first source that it can play, based on the format support of the user's browser.

# 31. Which type of audio formats are supported by HTML5?

HTML5 provides native support for a few different audio formats, including:

- MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer III)
- AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)
- Ogg/Vorbis

MP3 is the most widely used audio format and is supported by all major browsers. AAC is a popular format that offers better quality at lower bitrates than MP3, and is supported by most modern browsers. Ogg/Vorbis is an open-source format that is supported by some browsers, but its usage is not as widespread as MP3 or AAC.

When using the `<audio>` tag to embed audio in a web page, it is recommended to provide multiple sources in different formats to ensure compatibility across different browsers. This can be achieved by including multiple `<source>` tags within the `<audio>` tag, each with a different audio format:

```
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio.aac" type="audio/aac">
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>
```

In this example, the `<audio>` tag includes three `<source>` tags, each with a different audio format. The browser will automatically select the first source that it can play, based on the format support of the user's browser.

# 32. What are the different types of `<input>` in HTML?

The `<input>` tag is one of the most commonly used tags in HTML, and it has several different types that can be used to create various types of form controls. Here are some of the most common types of `<input>` tags:

- Text: `<input type="text">` = This type is used for single-line text input fields.
- Password: `<input type="password">` = This type is used for password fields, where the characters are hidden.
- Number: `<input type="number">` = This type is used for numeric input fields, with up and down arrows to increase or decrease the value.
- Checkbox: `<input type="checkbox">` = This type is used for checkboxes, where the user can select one or more options.
- Radio: `<input type="radio">` = This type is used for radio buttons, where the user can select one option from a group of options.
- Date: `<input type="date">` = This type is used for date input fields, with a calendar to select the date.
- Time: `<input type="time">` = This type is used for time input fields, with a clock to select the time.
- Email: `<input type="email">` = This type is used for email input fields, with built-in validation for email addresses.
- Search: `<input type="search">` = This type is used for search input fields, with a search icon and clear button.
- File: `<input type="file">` = This type is used for file input fields, allowing users to select and upload files from their device.

There are several other types of `<input>` tags, including hidden, range, color, tel, and more. Each type is designed for a specific use case, and using the appropriate type can help improve the user experience and make form input more efficient.
