# 1. What is HTML ?

<p>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it is a markup language used for creating web pages and other information that can be displayed in a web browser. It is the standard language used to structure content on the World Wide Web and is essential for creating web pages that are accessible and readable by users.

<p>
HTML uses tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets, to define the structure and content of a web page. These tags indicate how the content should be displayed in a browser, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, and forms. HTML also allows web developers to include other media, such as videos, audio, and animations, within web pages.

# 2. What are HTML tags?

<p>
HTML tags are the building blocks of HTML, and they define the structure and content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets and consist of a tag name, which indicates the type of element being defined, and optional attributes, which provide additional information about the element.
</p>

For example, the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph of text, and the `<img>` tag is used to insert an image into a web page.

Here is an example of a paragraph tag: `<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>`
In this example, the `<p>` tag defines the beginning of a paragraph, and the `</p>` tag defines the end of the paragraph.

<p>
HTML tags can be nested inside each other to create more complex structures, such as tables, lists, and forms. The way these tags are structured and nested determines the layout and appearance of a web page.
