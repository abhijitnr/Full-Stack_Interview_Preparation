# 1. What do you mean by Execution Context in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, an execution context is an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, it's run inside an execution context.

The Execution Context consists of two components: the `Memory Component` and the `Code Component`.

- `Memory Component` : The memory component contains values and functions organized in key-value pairs.
- `Code Component` : The Code Component is the place where all JavaScript code should be executed.

The memory component is known as the `"variable environment"`, and the code component is known as the `"thread of execution"`.
