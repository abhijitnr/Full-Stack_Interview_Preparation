<h1>JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers</h1>

# 1. What is JavaScript?

<p>
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language used primarily for creating interactive web pages and web applications. It is one of the three core technologies used in web development, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript code can be embedded directly into HTML documents, and can also be used on the server-side with the help of Node.js.
</p>
<p>
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 and was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript before being renamed to JavaScript. It has since become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, used by developers to create dynamic user interfaces, manipulate data, and create complex web applications. It is supported by all modern web browsers, and has a large and active developer community constantly contributing to its growth and evolution.

# 2. What do you mean by Execution Context in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, an execution context is an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, it's run inside an execution context.
</p>
<p>
The Execution Context consists of two components: the `Memory Component` and the `Code Component`.
</p>

- `Memory Component` : The memory component contains values and functions organized in key-value pairs.
- `Code Component` : The Code Component is the place where all JavaScript code should be executed.

<p>
The memory component is known as the `"variable environment"`, and the code component is known as the `"thread of execution"`.
</p>

# 3. What is call stack in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, the call stack is a mechanism used by the JavaScript engine to keep track of the execution context of a running program.
</p>
<p>
When a function is called, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack. This execution context includes information about the function such as its arguments, local variables, and the location of the code that called the function.
</p>
<p>
As the function executes, it may call other functions, which in turn create their own execution contexts that are also pushed onto the call stack. Each new function call adds a new execution context to the top of the stack.
</p>
<p>
When a function completes its execution, its execution context is popped off the stack, and control is returned to the function that called it. This continues until the entire program has executed.
</p>
<p>
The call stack has a finite size, and if too many functions are called, it can result in a stack overflow error. This can occur if a function calls itself recursively without a base case to stop the recursion.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the call stack is important for debugging JavaScript programs, as it can help identify the sequence of function calls that led to a particular error.
</p>

# 4. What do you mean by hoisting in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, hoisting is a mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase, before the actual execution of the code. This means that regardless of where the declarations appear in the code, they are processed first and become available for use throughout the code.
</p>
Hoisting can occur in two ways:

- Variable Hoisting: In JavaScript, variable declarations with the "var" keyword are automatically hoisted to the top of the current scope. However, only the declaration is hoisted, not the assignment. This means that if you try to access a variable before it has been assigned a value, it will return "undefined".

- Function Hoisting: Function declarations are also hoisted to the top of their respective scope, which means that they can be called before they are defined in the code. This is because the entire function declaration is hoisted, including its name and body. However, function expressions (such as arrow functions and anonymous functions) are not hoisted.

<p>
It is important to note that hoisting can sometimes cause unexpected behavior in your code, so it is best practice to always declare variables and functions at the top of their scope to avoid any potential issues.
</p>

# 5. What do you mean by undefined in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, `undefined` is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to a variable or property that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is also returned by functions that do not explicitly return a value.
</p>
For example, consider the following code:

```
let x; // x is declared but not assigned a value
console.log(x); // logs "undefined" to the console
```

<p>
In this case, `x` is declared as a variable but is not assigned a value. When `console.log(x)` is called, the value of `x` is `undefined`, which is printed to the console.
</p>
<p>
The `undefined` value is distinct from the `null` value, which is an explicit value that can be assigned to a variable or property to indicate the absence of any object value.
</p>
<p>
It's important to be aware of `undefined` when writing JavaScript code, as attempting to access a property or method of an undefined value will result in a runtime error. To avoid this, you can use conditional statements or optional chaining to check for `undefined` values before accessing their properties or methods.
</p>

# 6. What do you mean by scope in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, scope refers to the set of variables, functions, and objects that are accessible in a particular section of code. In other words, scope determines the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions in your code.
</p>
There are two main types of scope in JavaScript:

- Global scope : Variables declared outside of any function or block are considered to have global scope. These variables can be accessed from anywhere in the code, including inside functions and blocks.

- Local scope : Variables declared inside a function or block are considered to have local scope. These variables can only be accessed from within the function or block in which they are defined.

<p>
It's important to be aware of scope when writing JavaScript code, as it can affect the behavior of your program. For example, if you have two variables with the same name, but one is defined in the global scope and the other is defined in a local scope, they will be two separate variables with different values.
</p>

# 7. What is lexical environment in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, a lexical environment is a structure that holds identifiers (variables, functions) and their values, as well as references to any parent lexical environments.
</p>
<p>
A lexical environment is created whenever a function is invoked or a new block (e.g. an if statement, a loop, or a function body) is entered. The lexical environment is responsible for keeping track of the variables and functions defined in that function or block and providing a scope for them.
</p>
<p>
When a variable or function is referenced in JavaScript, the interpreter first looks for it within the current lexical environment. If it's not found, it searches the parent lexical environment, continuing up the chain until it reaches the global environment.
</p>
<p>
Each time a new function is created, a new lexical environment is created along with it, which has access to the parent environment's variables and functions. This is known as lexical scoping, which is a way to determine the scope of an identifier based on its location in the source code.
</p>
<p>
Understanding lexical environments is important in JavaScript because it allows you to understand how variables and functions are scoped and how they behave within different functions and blocks.
</p>

# 8. What is scope chain in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, the scope chain is a hierarchical chain of lexical environments that are searched for variables and functions when they are referenced within a function.
</p>

<p>
When a variable or function is referenced within a function, the JavaScript engine searches the current lexical environment for the variable or function. If it's not found, the engine then looks in the parent environment, and continues up the chain until it finds the variable or function, or until it reaches the global environment.
</p>

<p>
The scope chain is created by the nested structure of lexical environments, with each nested function or block creating a new environment that is linked to its parent environment. This chain of environments creates a hierarchical structure that determines the scope of variables and functions within a function.
</p>

<p>
It's important to understand the scope chain in JavaScript because it determines the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions within a function. If a variable or function is defined in a higher-level lexical environment, it can be accessed within nested functions or blocks. However, if it's defined within a nested function or block, it can only be accessed within that function or block, and its child functions and blocks.
</p>

<p>
Overall, the scope chain plays an important role in the scoping rules of JavaScript, and understanding it is key to writing effective and maintainable code.
</p>

# 9. What is Temporal Dead Zone in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior that occurs when trying to access a variable that has been declared with `let` or `const` but has not yet been initialized.
</p>

<p>
During the TDZ, attempting to access the variable will result in a `ReferenceError`. The TDZ begins at the start of the scope where the variable is declared and lasts until the point where the variable is initialized.
</p>

For example:

```
console.log(myVariable); // Throws a ReferenceError

let myVariable = 'Hello World';
```

<p>
In the code above, trying to access the `myVariable` before it has been initialized will throw a `ReferenceError` because it is still in the TDZ.
</p>

<p>
This behavior is intended to prevent developers from accessing uninitialized variables and ensure that they are properly initialized before being used. It's important to be aware of the TDZ when working with `let` and `const` variables in JavaScript.
</p>

# 10. What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?

<p>
In JavaScript, there are several types of errors that can occur during the execution of a program. Some of the most common types of errors are:
</p>

- Syntax errors: These occur when there is a mistake in the syntax of the code. For example, if a variable is declared with an invalid name or if a function is not properly closed with a curly brace.

- Runtime errors: These occur when the code is being executed and something unexpected happens, such as trying to access a property of an undefined object or dividing by zero.

- Logical errors: These occur when the code runs without errors, but the output is not what was expected. This can happen if there is a mistake in the logic of the code or if the program is not properly handling edge cases.

- Type errors: These occur when an operation or function is performed on a value of the wrong type. For example, trying to add a number to a string or call a non-function value as a function.

<p>
It's important to understand the different types of errors in JavaScript so that you can properly handle them in your code and write more robust programs. You can use debugging tools like the console and breakpoints to help identify and fix errors.
