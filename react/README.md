<h1>React.js Interview Questions and Answers</h1>

# 1. What is React.js?

<p>
React.js is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs). It was developed by Facebook and released in 2013. React allows developers to build reusable UI components and compose them to create complex UIs for web applications.
</p>

<p>
React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) which allows for efficient updates to the UI without having to manipulate the actual DOM directly. This improves the performance of the application and makes it faster and more responsive. React also supports server-side rendering, which means that the initial rendering of the UI can be done on the server, improving the performance of the application even further.
</p>

<p>
React is often used in conjunction with other libraries or frameworks, such as Redux for state management or Next.js for server-side rendering and routing. React has become very popular in the web development community and is used by many large companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Airbnb, and Netflix.
</p>

# 2. What is JSX in React?

<p>
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like syntax in their JavaScript code. It is used in React to define the structure of the UI components.
</p>

<p>
JSX allows developers to define the structure of their UI components in a more intuitive way than traditional JavaScript. For example, instead of using functions to create HTML elements, developers can use JSX syntax to define the structure of the UI components directly in their JavaScript code.
</p>

Here is an example of how JSX can be used to define a simple UI component in React:

```
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>This is a simple React app.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

<p>

In this example, the `App` component is defined using JSX syntax, which allows the component to render a `div` element containing an `h1` and a `p` element.

</p>

<p>
JSX is not required to use React, but it is a common and recommended approach for defining the structure of UI components in React applications.
</p>

# 3. What are the rules of JSX in React?

<p>
JSX in React follows a set of rules to ensure that the code is compiled and executed correctly. Here are some of the key rules of JSX in React:
</p>

- JSX tags must always be closed: Every JSX tag must be closed, even if there is no content inside the tag. This can be done either by using a self-closing tag (`<img src="example.png" />`) or by adding a closing tag (`<div></div>`).

- One root element per JSX expression: JSX expressions must have only one root element. This means that all JSX expressions must have a single outermost element that contains all other elements. For example, the following code would not be valid JSX because it has two root elements (`<h1>` and `<p>`):

  ```
  return (
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  );
  ```

  To make this valid JSX, you would need to wrap the elements inside a single root element:

  ```
  return (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
  );
  ```

- JSX expressions can be interpolated: JSX expressions can be interpolated with curly braces `{}`. This allows you to embed JavaScript expressions inside JSX expressions. For example:

  ```
  return (
  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>{`${firstName} ${lastName}`}</p>
  </div>
  );
  ```

  In this example, the variables `title`, `firstName`, and `lastName` are interpolated inside the JSX expression.

- JSX expressions are compiled to JavaScript: JSX expressions are not valid JavaScript, so they need to be compiled to JavaScript before they can be executed in a browser. This can be done using a build tool like Babel, which compiles JSX expressions into plain JavaScript that can be understood by the browser.

<p>
By following these rules, we can write valid JSX expressions that can be compiled into efficient and effective JavaScript code for your React applications.
</p>
 
# 4. What is the Components in React?

<p>
Components in React are reusable UI elements that can be composed together to create complex user interfaces. A component can be thought of as a small piece of a larger user interface, which can be reused throughout an application. Components can be either function components or class components.
</p>

- Function components are simple components that are defined as functions. They take in props as input and return a React element that describes what should be rendered to the screen. Here is an example of a simple function component that takes in a `name` prop and displays a greeting:

  ```
  function Greeting(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
  }
  ```

- Class components are more complex components that are defined as ES6 classes. They have a more extensive API than function components and can be used to handle state, lifecycle methods, and other advanced features. Here is an example of a class component that uses state to track the number of clicks on a button:

  ```
  class ClickCounter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Number of clicks: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  }
  ```

<p>
Components can also be composed together to create more complex user interfaces. For example, you might use a combination of simple components like buttons and text inputs to create a login form component that can be reused throughout your application.
</p>

<p>
By breaking down user interfaces into smaller, reusable components, React makes it easier to build and maintain large-scale applications.
</p>

# 5. What is props in React?

<p>
In React, "props" (short for properties) is a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
</p>

<p>
When a React component is rendered, it can receive a set of "props" as an object, which contains key-value pairs of data. These props can be accessed within the component's code and used to control its behavior and output.
</p>
Here's an example of how props might be used in a React component:

```
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.text}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

<MyComponent title="My Title" text="Some text goes here." />
```

In this example, `MyComponent` is a function component that accepts a set of props (in this case, `title` and `text`). These props are then used within the component's code to render a heading and paragraph of text. When the component is used elsewhere in the code, the props are passed in as attributes, like `title="My Title"` and `text="Some text goes here."`.

# 6. What are the two different types of import/export in React?

In React, there are two different ways to use the `import` and `export` statements: default exports and named exports.

- Default exports : A default export allows you to export one item per module as the "default" export. This is done using the `export default` statement. When importing a default export, you can use any name you like for the imported item. Here's an example:

  ```
  // file1.js
  const myValue = 42;
  export default myValue;

  // file2.js
  import myValue from './file1.js';
  console.log(myValue); // output: 42
  ```

  In this example, we're exporting a single value (`myValue`) as the default export of `file1.js`. In `file2.js`, we're importing that value using the name `myValue`.

- Named exports : A named export allows you to export multiple items per module with specific names. This is done using the `export` statement. When importing named exports, you must use the exact same name as the exported item. Here's an example:

  ```
  // file1.js
  export const foo = 'bar';
  export const baz = 42;

  // file2.js
  import { foo, baz } from './file1.js';
  console.log(foo, baz); // output: bar 42
  ```

  In this example, we're exporting two values (`foo` and `baz`) as named exports of `file1.js`. In `file2.js`, we're importing those values using their exact names (`foo` and `baz`). Note that we're using curly braces (`{}`) around the imported names to indicate that they're named exports.

# 7. What do you mean by ternary operator in React?

In React, a ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an `if-else` statement that allows you to conditionally render a component or a part of a component based on a boolean expression.

The ternary operator takes three operands: a condition, a value to return if the condition is true, and a value to return if the condition is false. The syntax for the ternary operator in React is :

```
condition ? trueValue : falseValue
```

Here, `condition` is the expression that you want to evaluate, `trueValue` is the value that is returned if the condition is true, and `falseValue` is the value that is returned if the condition is false.

For example, suppose you want to conditionally render a button in a component based on a boolean `isDisabled`. You could use the ternary operator to achieve this as follows :

```
function MyComponent(props) {
  const isDisabled = props.isDisabled;

  return (
    <div>
      {isDisabled ? (
        <button disabled>Disabled</button>
      ) : (
        <button>Enabled</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, if `isDisabled` is true, the first button with the `disabled` attribute will be rendered, and if it is false, the second button without the `disabled` attribute will be rendered.
